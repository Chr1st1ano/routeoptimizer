**A native PHP-based intelligent routing engine built with Laravel and php-ml.**

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Predictive Route Optimizer** is a web application that calculates the most efficient delivery paths based on historical data. Unlike traditional routing that relies solely on external APIs for logic, this project utilizes **php-ml** to perform machine learning operations directly within the PHP environment, predicting traffic coefficients and optimizing routes locally.

### 🎯 Key Features
* **Native ML Integration:** Uses `php-ml` (Regression/Classification) to forecast route times without requiring a separate Python microservice.
* **Dynamic Routing:** Calculates optimal paths between multiple coordinates.
* **Database Management:** Robust data handling using MySQL and manageable via phpMyAdmin.
* **Server-Side Rendering:** Fast, SEO-friendly interface built with Laravel Blade templates.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* PHP >= 8.1
* Composer
* MySQL

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-route-optimizer.git](https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-route-optimizer.git)
    cd predictive-route-optimizer
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Use Composer to install the Laravel framework and the `php-ml` library.
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**
    Copy the example environment file and configure your database settings.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Open `.env` and set your database credentials:*
    ```ini
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=route_optimizer
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

4.  **Generate App Key**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Database Migration**
    Create the tables for routes, historical data, and user logs.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **Train the Model (Optional)**
    If you have a seeding script to pre-train the `php-ml` model:
    ```bash
    php artisan ml:train
    ```

7.  **Serve the Application**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    Access the app at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## 🧠 How It Works (php-ml)

This project avoids the complexity of microservices by keeping the ML logic within PHP.

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Historical trip data (distance, time of day, weather condition) is stored in MySQL.
2.  **Training:** The `php-ml` library uses this data to train a **LeastSquares Regression** (or similar) model.
3.  **Prediction:** When a user requests a route via the Blade interface, the controller passes the coordinates to the model, which predicts the estimated time of arrival (ETA) based on learned patterns.
